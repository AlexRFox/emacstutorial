Stuff about emacs, dumped into one file for future reference. No
particular order. This file is far from complete, I'm almost learning
new things. The best ways to learn about emacs are:

Guessing
Stumbling on something ("what. the. heck. just. happened. how can i
 reproduce it?")
Mix of those two, and looking it up
Browsing internet
Reading the manual (seriously, it's amazing. Especially when you start
 developing an intuition for emacs)
 - http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html#Top
If you ever think "i wish emacs had X", google it! There's a good
 chance emacs does, and/or someone has written something for it that
 will do it.
