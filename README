These are designed to be an easy introduction to emacs. I made the
first video over two years ago (Jan 2010) and so far it has been a
success. I'm designing future (at least early) lessons around having
very short videos with only 3-5 commands. Later ones will probably
have to get longer as the concepts I'm explaining get more
complicated. I might put together compilations of chunks of the short
videos instead of having a lot of separate playlists for those
interested in a larger amount of material at once, send me a message
if you'd be interested in that.

Lesson 2: Script in progress in this repository, feel free to send me
       	  feedback.

I'm currently an undergrad at MIT and this project has been stalled
for a long time so I might wind up abandoning this again for a while
before working on it again. If you want me to make this project a
higher priority, send me a message! I'd love to hear from you.
